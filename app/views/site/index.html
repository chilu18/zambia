        <h2>What is Code & Coffee?</h2>
        <p>Code & Coffee is an informal get together to write some code in the morning before the real job kicks in. There are no requirements other than the willingness to sit down, pair up, and learn something new. We're going with mornings because the evenings are full enough as it is. Why add to the chaos of user groups, soccer games, and lawn mowing?</p>
        <p>If you're interested in joining in, just show up. No invited needed, you don't need to RSVP, you just need a laptop. Coffee not provided, but it's just a few steps away.</p>
        <p>Code & Coffee locations are available world wide, check <em>Where and When</em> below to see if there's one near you. If there isn't a location near you, start one! It's fun!</p>
